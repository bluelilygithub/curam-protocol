### Key Findings

**What Accounting Does Better:**
1. âœ… **Problem framing** - "The Mid-Market Trap" is brilliant positioning
2. âœ… **Concrete automation examples** - Shows EXACTLY what gets automated (3-way match, GL coding, fraud detection)
3. âœ… **Math is transparent** - "10% Capacity Shift" section walks through ROI step-by-step
4. âœ… **Specificity wins trust** - "48 hours/week × $250/hr × 48 weeks = $576,000" is more credible than vague promises

**What Legal Does Better:**
1. âœ… **FAQ section** - Addresses 5 critical objections (Accounting page has ZERO FAQs!)
2. âœ… **Integration specificity** - Names actual software (ActionStep, LEAP, Smokeball)
3. âœ… **Privilege concerns** - Directly addresses legal professional privilege (critical for lawyers)

**Critical Gaps:**
- **Accounting page is MISSING FAQs** - This is a major oversight for a professional services audience
- **Legal page lacks automation examples** - Doesn't show WHAT gets automated (just says "contract intelligence")
- **Both pages could strengthen** industry-specific case studies

## Universal Page Structure (Best of Both)

Use this template for ALL future industry pages.

### Section 1: Hero (Above the Fold)

**Required Elements:**
```
For [TARGET AUDIENCE]

# [HEADLINE: Emotional Pain Point + Promise]

[SUBHEADLINE: Specific problem + specific solution + quantified outcome]

[Primary CTA: Book Feasibility Sprint ($1,500)]
[Secondary CTA: Calculate ROI]

[Risk-Free Badge: "$1,500 fully refundable if <90% accuracy"]
```

**Examples:**
- Legal: "Stop Losing Billable Hours to Manual Administrative Work"
- Accounting: "Break the Revenue Ceiling Without Breaking Your Culture"

**Formula for Future Industries:**
- Healthcare: "Stop Losing Clinical Hours to Administrative Chaos"
- Engineering: "Unlock 200+ Hours Per Project Hidden in Manual Documentation"
- Logistics: "Stop Bleeding Margin to Manual Freight Processing"

---

### Section 2: The Problem Framework ⭐ **CRITICAL**

**Template: "The [Industry] Trap"**

This is where **Accounting page WINS**. Replicate this structure for all industries.

```markdown
## The [Industry] Trap: [Specific Market Position Problem]

You're caught in a squeeze that's [eroding margins / limiting growth / burning capacity]:

### ⬆️ Pressure from Above
[Who's automating at enterprise scale and competing on your turf]

### ⬇️ Pressure from Below
[What commodity tools are eating your low-end work]

### 🎯 The Gap: Your Opportunity
[The complex work that still requires humans... but is killing your capacity]

**The Result:** [Specific description of the capacity constraint + talent drain + margin pressure]
```

**Example (Accounting):**
- Pressure from Above: Big 4 + enterprise AI
- Pressure from Below: Xero + Receipt Bank
- The Gap: Complex GL coding, inter-entity reconciliations
- Result: Seniors doing $150/hr work instead of $300/hr advisory

**Example (Legal - NEEDS UPDATING):**
- Pressure from Above: ALSPs + contract automation platforms
- Pressure from Below: LegalZoom + template libraries
- The Gap: Complex contract review, matter-specific research
- Result: Fee earners buried in admin instead of client-facing work

---

### Section 3: Quantified Value Proposition ⭐ **CRITICAL**

**Template: "What If You Recovered Just X% of [Resource]?"**

This is where **Accounting page's "10% Capacity Shift" section SHINES**. Replicate this.

```markdown
## What If You Recovered Just [X%] of [Senior Capacity / Clinical Hours / Project Time]?

You don't need a radical transformation. Automating [specific workflows] frees [resource] for [higher-value work].

### The Baseline
[Firm Size]
- [Staff breakdown]
- Average [Rate]: $X/hr
- Current Capacity: X% Utilized
- **Constraint:** [What's blocking growth]

### The Protocol Effect
[X%] Capacity Shift
- **Shift:** Automate [specific tasks] ([X] hrs/week total)
- **Gain:** [X] hours/week redeployed to [higher-value work]
- **Value:** [X] hrs × $[Y]/hr × 48 weeks =
- **$[Z] New Revenue**

**Investment vs Return:** Total project cost is ~$[Investment]. ROI is ~[X]x in Year 1 alone, without [hiring / expanding facilities / etc.].
```

**Why This Works:**
- âœ… Transparent math builds trust
- âœ… "Just 10%" feels achievable (not radical)
- âœ… Specific to firm size (relatable)
- âœ… Shows ROI without hiring (removes objection)

---

### Section 4: Technical Credibility (Automation Examples) ⭐ **CRITICAL**

**Template: Show WHAT Gets Automated (Not Just "AI Magic")**

This is where **Accounting page WINS HARD**. Legal page is too vague.

```markdown
## Beyond Basic [OCR / Automation / AI]. We Automate [Logic / Judgment / Complexity].

Generic tools capture data. We capture the [judgment calls / complex decisions] that usually require a human.

[EXAMPLE 1: The Three-Way Match / Contract Clause Detection / Transmittal Matching]
[Show BEFORE state with sample data]
---
[Show AFTER state with automated decision]
Result: [Specific outcome]

[EXAMPLE 2: Automated GL Coding / Matter Classification / Shipment Routing]
[Show decision tree that AI handles]
Result: [Specific outcome]

[EXAMPLE 3: The Fraud Shield / Compliance Alert / Risk Flag]
[Show edge case detection]
Result: [Specific outcome]
```

**Why This Works:**
- âœ… Shows you understand their workflow (not generic AI hype)
- âœ… Demonstrates technical depth (not just OCR)
- âœ… Builds confidence ("They've done this before")

**Examples to Create:**
- **Legal:** Contract clause extraction → matter management auto-population
- **Healthcare:** Clinical note extraction → billing code suggestion
- **Engineering:** Drawing register automation from Revit metadata
- **Logistics:** BOL extraction → customs documentation pre-fill

---

### Section 5: Trust & Governance

**Template: Industry-Specific Compliance**

```markdown
## [Audit-Grade Reliability / Clinical-Grade Safety / Engineering-Grade Precision]

This isn't just about speed. It's about [governance / safety / liability / audit trails].

### Governance First
For [Risk Managers / Compliance Officers / CFOs]
✅ **Data Sovereignty:** [Where data lives, who controls it]
✅ **Audit Trails:** [How decisions are logged]
✅ **Compliance:** [Industry-specific regulations met]

### Efficiency
For [Operations / Shared Services / Project Teams]
✅ **Speed:** [Specific throughput metric]
✅ **Integration:** [How it connects to existing systems]
✅ **Accuracy:** [Benchmark accuracy metric]
```

**Industry-Specific Examples:**
- **Legal:** Legal professional privilege + Law Society guidelines
- **Accounting:** TPB/ATO compliance + trust account rules
- **Healthcare:** HIPAA + clinical documentation standards
- **Engineering:** AS/NZS standards + liability insurance requirements

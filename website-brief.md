# FSACE Website Redesign: Strategic Brief & Specifications
**Date:** November 2025
**Project:** Pivot to Productized Services
**Output Format:** Responsive Web Design (Desktop/Mobile)

---

## 1. STRATEGIC MOTIVATION (READ THIS FIRST)
**Context:**
Currently, FSACE is positioned as a general AI consultancy. This creates friction because engineering clients fear open-ended consulting hours, lack of tangible deliverables, and implementation risk.

**The Pivot:**
We are moving from "Selling Consulting Hours" to **"Selling a Productized System."**
We are rebranding our methodology as **"The FSACE Protocol™"**—a proprietary, 4-phase framework.

**The Goal of the Design:**
The website must not look like a freelancer's portfolio. It must look like the home of a **proven engineering system**.
1.  **Systematization:** The visual language must look like a blueprint/machine. It must feel like a rigorous engineering process.
2.  **Segmentation:** We need to filter clients immediately based on their blocker (Skepticism vs. Budget vs. Compliance).
3.  **Risk Reversal:** We are transparent with pricing and timelines to remove the "Black Box" fear.

## 2. VISUAL IDENTITY & VIBE
**Aesthetic:** "Premium Engineering." Think McKinsey meets SpaceX.
*   **Primary Color:** Deep Navy Blue (`#0F172A`) — Signals Trust, Enterprise, Stability.
*   **Accent Color:** Gold/Bronze (`#D4AF37`) — Signals Premium Value, "The Gold Standard."
*   **Typography:**
    *   *Headings:* Premium Serif (e.g., *Playfair Display*, *Merriweather*) — For "The Protocol" and high-level promises.
    *   *Body:* Clean Sans-Serif (e.g., *Inter*, *Roboto*) — For technical details and pricing.
*   **Visual Motif:** Blueprints, Pipelines, Linear Connections, Structured Grids.
*   **Avoid:** Generic "AI Brain" stock photos, purple/pink gradients, cartoon illustrations.

**Visual References (Inspiration):**
1.  **McKinsey Operations:** For the clean, white-space heavy, premium consulting feel.
2.  **Stripe Pricing:** For the clean, transparent product cards.
3.  **Engineering Software (e.g., Bentley/Autodesk):** For the use of Navy/Gold and technical precision.

## 3. HOMEPAGE WIREFRAME & COPY
*Please implement the sections in this exact order.*

### SECTION 1: HERO (Above the Fold)
*   **Background:** Deep Navy.
*   **Headline:** Systematized AI Implementation for Structural Engineers.
*   **Subhead:** Stop paying consultants to "figure it out." We deploy **The FSACE Protocol™**—a proven, four-phase framework to validate, plan, and secure your AI transformation.
*   **Primary CTA (Button):** Calculate Your ROI *(Links to existing calculator)*

*   **Tertiary Link (Text):** View The Protocol ↓ *(Anchor scroll to Section 2)*

### SECTION 2: THE METHODOLOGY (The Protocol Diagram)
*   **Concept:** A horizontal pipeline showing the 4 phases. See "Component Specs" below.
*   **Headline:** We don't guess. We follow The Protocol.
*   **Subhead:** Most firms fail at AI because they jump straight to implementation. We use a standardized, engineering-specific methodology to ensure ROI before a single line of code is written.
*   **The 4 Phases (Cards):**
    1.  **Validation:** The Feasibility Sprint ($1.5k)
    2.  **Strategy:** The Readiness Roadmap ($7.5k)
    3.  **Governance:** The Compliance Shield ($8-12k)
    4.  **Deployment:** Wave 1 Implementation ($20-30k)

### SECTION 3: THE SELECTOR (Self-Segmentation)
*   **Concept:** A "Problem -> Solution" map. Users identify their pain, and we point them to the right product.
*   **Headline:** Where should you start?
*   **Subhead:** Choose the entry point that matches your current blocker.
*   **Logic (Rows):**
    *   *Blocker:* "I don't believe AI can handle our messy documents." → **Start at Phase 1 (Feasibility)**
    *   *Blocker:* "I know it works, but I need a budget and plan." → **Start at Phase 2 (Roadmap)**
    *   *Blocker:* "I am blocked by IT security or Insurance." → **Start at Phase 3 (Compliance)**

### SECTION 4: THE PRODUCTS (Pricing Cards)
*   **Layout:** 3 Columns. Card style.

    *   100% Insurer Audit Pass Rate
    *   14 Firms in Live Deployment

### SECTION 6: FAQ & OBJECTIONS
*   **Q: Why FSACE vs. Generic Consultant?**
    *   A: We sell Outcomes, not Hours. Our models are pre-trained on engineering data. You pay for the IP, not the learning curve.
*   **Q: What if Phase 1 fails?**
    *   A: You walk away. If our Feasibility Sprint shows your data is too messy for automation, we tell you immediately. You save thousands on a failed implementation.

    *   "Secure Roadmap" → Link to Booking Flow.
    *   "Audit Risk" → Link to Contact Form.
*   **Existing Assets:**
    *   Current Live Demo (`fsace-invoices...`) should be moved to the Footer or "How it Works" page. Do not put it in the main funnel flow; we want to sell the *Feasibility Sprint*, not give away the tool for free.
    *   We will provide the logo files separately.

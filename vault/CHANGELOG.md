**Feature:** Configurable default model for chat and new projects.

Previously the "standard" model slot (used for all general chat and new projects) was derived positionally from the `vault_models` list — always the second Anthropic model. There was no way to set it explicitly.

**Changes:**
- `modelResolver.js` now fetches both `vault_models` and `default_model` settings in one query. If `default_model` is set, it overrides the positional standard-slot logic.
- `useModels` hook exposes `defaultModel` and `saveDefaultModel`, loaded from the `default_model` settings key.
- Settings page (AI & Chat tab) shows a "Default model" `<select>` above the model list, populated from configured models. Blank option = system default (Sonnet 4.6). Saves instantly on change.
- `NewProjectModal` loads `default_model` on open and uses it as the initial model instead of the hardcoded `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`.

**Change:** Token optimisation pass on `buildSystemPrompt()` in `chat.js`.

Removed filler instructions and shortened verbose field labels throughout the system prompt. No behaviour change — purely cosmetic text reduction.

**Specific changes:**
- Block 1: removed `'You are a helpful AI assistant.'` fallback (no-op instruction); `'You are an AI assistant for the project X'` → `Project: "X"`
- Block 2: removed `'Provide focused, actionable assistance based on this project context.'` (pure filler); shortened labels — `Problem being solved:` → `Problem:`, `Target audience:` → `Audience:`, `Success criteria:` → `Success:`, `Communication tone:` → `Tone:`, `Additional notes:` → `Notes:`
- Block 3: `Persistent user memory:` → `Memory:`
- Block 4: `The following project files are pinned and included in full below:` → `Pinned files:`; `Files selected for this session:` → `Session files:`; `Pinned web pages:` → `Web pages:`
- Block 5 (web search): trimmed ~25 tokens from the web search instruction; security warning preserved but tightened
- Summarised session injection: assistant filler response (~19 tokens) → `'OK.'` (1 token)
- Summarise prompt: tightened
- Suggestions prompt: tightened

## 2026-04-15

**Issue:** Invoices (and other finance records) saved with wrong date — off by one day for Australian users.

**Root cause:** `todayStr()` in `FinancePage.jsx` used `new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)`, which returns the UTC date. In Australia (AEST = UTC+10), any time before 10am means the UTC date is still the previous day. This caused new invoices, expenses, wages, journal entries, and mark-paid dates to default to yesterday's local date.

**Solution:** Rewrote `todayStr()` to use local-time methods (`getFullYear()`, `getMonth()`, `getDate()`) so the returned `YYYY-MM-DD` string always reflects the user's local date, consistent with how the date range filter (`getPresetRange`) already worked.

**Issue:** "Invoice created" toast fires but no invoice is saved to the database.

**Root cause:** Two problems working together. First, `BLANK_ITEM` initialises `unitPrice` as an empty string (`''`). The server computed correct numeric values but then passed the original `item.unitPrice` (still `''`) as a PostgreSQL parameter for a `NUMERIC(10,2)` column — PostgreSQL cannot cast an empty string to numeric and throws an error, rolling back the entire transaction. Second, `api.post` in `apiClient.js` only throws on 401 responses, so the 500 error was silently ignored and the success toast fired anyway.

**Solution:** Server now stores the parsed numeric values (`item._qty`, `item._up`) during the calculation loop and uses those in the INSERT — both POST and PUT invoice routes. Added `res.ok` checking in the frontend `save()` function so server errors surface as a visible error message instead of a false success toast.
